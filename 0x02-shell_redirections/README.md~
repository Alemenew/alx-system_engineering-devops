**This is ALX system engineering development project on I/O redirecting and filters**

This project is used to learn about standard input and output redirection 

Redirection means when we are using our command line we are always interacting in 3 ways :-  input ,output ,and error.

"*" Output redirection ( >)  putting our output or result in files instead of printing on the screen.
"*" Input redirection (<) accepting from file instead of keyboard.

"*" Redirection error is putting error on the file 

**0-hello_world** This script is used for printing hello world.
